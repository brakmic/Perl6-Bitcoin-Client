# Perl6 Bitcoin Client

This is a client for accessing the Bitcoin [REST API](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md)

A Bitcoin Full Node with activated REST-API is needed.

To activate the API set the flag *rest* to **1** in
[bitcoin.conf](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin) and open the port **8332**.
